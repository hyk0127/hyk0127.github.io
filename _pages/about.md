Hello! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

My work is in the intersection of international trade and industrial organization, and I focus on intra-firm transactions and incentives within integrated networks of firms. I am on the job market in academic year 2021-2022, and will be available for interviews at the EEA and ASSA 2022 Virtual Annual Meetings.
