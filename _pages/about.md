Hello! 

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of California, Los Angeles. 

My work is in the intersection of international trade and industrial organization, and I focus on intra-firm transactions and incentives within integrated networks of firms. 

I am excited to join Korea Institute of Public Finance (KIPF) as an Associate Research Fellow in August 2022.
