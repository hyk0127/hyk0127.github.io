I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of California, Los Angeles. My work is in the intersection of trade and industrial organization, and I focus on intra-firm trades and incentives within vertical integration. I am on the job market and will be available for interviews at the ASSA 2022 Virtual Annual Meeting, Jan 7-9, 2022.
