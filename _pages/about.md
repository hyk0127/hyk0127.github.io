Hello! 

I am joining the Korea Institute of Public Finance (KIPF) as an Associate Research Fellow in August 2022. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2022. 

My research interests are in the intersection of international trade and industrial organization. Specifically, I focus on intra-firm transactions and incentives within ownership networks of firms.
