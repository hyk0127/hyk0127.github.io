Welcome!

I am an Associate Fellow at the Korea Institute of Public Finance (KIPF). 

My research interests are in the intersection of industrial organization and corporate finance. 
Specifically, I focus on intra-firm transactions and incentives within ownership networks of firms. 

I received my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of California, Los Angeles in 2022.
